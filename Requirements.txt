git add requirements.txt
   git commit -m "Fix: Simplify requirements.txt"
   git push
```

3. **In Streamlit Cloud**, click **"Reboot app"** or it will auto-deploy

### 💡 Why This Works:

- Streamlit Cloud automatically includes `protobuf` and other dependencies
- Simpler is better - let package managers handle sub-dependencies
- No version constraints means it gets the latest compatible versions

### ⚠️ Alternative: Check File Location

Make sure your `requirements.txt` is in the **root directory** of your repo:
```
your-repo/
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt  ← Must be here
└── README.md
